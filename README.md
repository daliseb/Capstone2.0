# Capstone 2.0- Team Collaboration
Project By: 

# Objective:
The main goal of this project is to collaboratively improve an existing our first project by fixing issues and implementing meaningful enhancements to enhance the user experience. Our other goals include:
-Using teamwork to succesfully collaborate in and complete a coding project.
-Learn from our team members.
-Reflect on where we started (the beginning of LTCA) vs. to our knowledge on the present day.


# Planning Process And Identifying Scope:
The scope is a clear path for our project, it helps us to identify what we are doing and our goal. It prevents us from creating making unnecessary edits or wasting time. Identifying a clear scope aids in creating a clear goal for the team, dividing the work/content and making sure that we stay on time and meet deadlines. 



# Project Selection
-Whose project is it? Why did we choose it? What would we like to fix? 
We chose Dalis's project to enhance, we chose this application because the original code was simple and had no extra components. The application runs and does the basic actions such as adding a deposit, payment and displaying the transactions on the ledger screen. We decided to take up phase 3, which incorporates the "Challenge Yourself" section of the capstone. 

The user should be able to do a custom search on the transactions and filter them by date, description, vendor and amount from the CSV file.
