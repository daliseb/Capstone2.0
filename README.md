# Capstone 2.0- Team Collaboration
Project By: 

# Objective:
The main goal of this project is to collaboratively improve an existing our first project by fixing issues and implementing meaningful enhancements to enhance the user experience. Our other goals include:
-Using teamwork to succesfully collaborate in and complete a coding project.
-Learn from our team members.
-Reflect on where we started (the beginning of LTCA) vs. to our knowledge on the present day.


# Planning Process and Identifying Scope:
Defining the project scope gives the team a clear direction and goal. It helps us stay focused on what needs to be done, avoid unnecessary changes, and use our time efficiently. A well defined scope also allows us to divide work effectively, stay on schedule, and meet deadlines.

Above, I have added a picture of our Kanban Board in Jira, we decided to use the kanban board as this project was shorter. Creating an outline and agenda for our capstone was essential as it helped us visualize the steps and tackle them faster.



# Project Selection
Whose project is it? Why did we choose it? What would we like to fix?
We chose to enhance Dalis’s project because the original application was simple and functional. It successfully performs core features such as adding deposits and payments, and displaying transactions on the ledger screen.

Our team decided to focus on Phase 3 of the capstone, which includes the “Challenge Yourself” requirements. We improved the application by adding a custom search feature that allows users to filter transactions from the CSV file by date, description, vendor, and amount. This enhancement benefits the user by making it easier and faster to locate specific transactions, review spending history, and manage financial records more efficiently.

^We have included a picture of the instructions above, they clearly list what is needed. 



# Team Roles
Dalis – Team Lead
Led team coordination by setting the agenda, assigning roles and responsibilities, ensuring project timeline was met, and creating the project README.

Nathaniel and Morgan – Developer Team 1
They were responsible for implementing the custom search functionality. This team worked on the original version of the code, handled troubleshooting, and ensured that the application continued to run smoothly and correctly throughout development. 

Ayanna and Kenya – Developer Team 2
They focused on enhancing the visual design of the “Challenge Yourself” instructions. Their contributions included adding color and improving the overall look to make the instructions more engaging for the user and easier to follow.  

# Problem 1 ( phase 3 )
Team 1 implemented the “Custom Search” feature on the reports screen as part of the Challenge Yourself requirements. This was Phase 3. They added a new menu option that prompts the user to enter search criteria, including start date, end date, description, vendor, and amount.

^Above is a screenshot of the application classes before modifying.

The search was designed to be flexible and user-friendly. If a user enters a value for a specific field, the system filters transactions based on that input. If a field is left blank, the application ignores that filter and continues searching using the remaining criteria. This approach allows users to easily narrow down transactions or perform broad searches without being required to fill in every field. 

Below is a screenshot of the code after it was modified.

Team one created a new class to make this process easier ^^



# Problem 2 ( phase 3, part 2 )

Team 2 customized the console application to give it a unique identity and improve the overall user experience. This included creating a custom app name and adding a starter screen that displays when the application launches.

^^ Above, I have added what the menu's looked like before.

They also tailored how transactions are presented so they align with the theme of the app, making the data feel more relevant and engaging. For example, transactions were formatted to reflect a specific use case such as restaurant purchases, record store sales, or clothing store transactions. This customization helps make the application more intuitive and visually consistent for the user, while still maintaining all core functionality.

Our previous capstones proved to be incredibly helpful, they served as a source to reference.

# Challenges & Lessons Learned
challenges as a team? ways that we worked well, did we strengthen any skills?

Throughout this project, our team faced challenges related to coordinating changes across shared code and ensuring new features integrated smoothly with existing functionality. Our biggest struggle stemed from learned how to collaborate on github, we learned as we went and askedf for help from our peers. (Thank you to everyone that helped us)
As a team, we worked well by dividing tasks based on strengths, regularly checking in on progress, and supporting one another during debugging and troubleshooting. This collaboration helped us resolve issues more efficiently and avoid duplicated effort. Splitting up the responsibilities required clear communication and attention to detail.

Through this process, we strengthened several key skills, including teamwork, problem solving, and code organization. We learned to communicate technical ideas clearly, and manage our time effectively while working toward shared deadlines.
